Plans:

1) Evaluate the 'ideal world' rankings - if each player was involved in every combination match up each week, who would currently be on top

2) Lucky (lowest winning score) &/or win with most other league defeats

3) Unlucky (highest winning score) &/or loss with most league wins

4) Most consistent by SD metrics

5) Highest winning margin

6) Most scores under 100

7) Most scores over 150

8) Something concerning the quality of scores each week - which Bye weeks had the most impact

9) Who fares best against teams with a winning record

10) Who fares worst against teams with a losing record
